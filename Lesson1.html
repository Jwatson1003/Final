    <h2> What is the Internet</h2>
    <h3> Background </h3>
    <p>Each computer has a specific IP address in the form of nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn  with each nnn ranging from 0-255.
    </p>

  <p>When your data is transferred, it's delivered in messages and packets, Data sent over the internet is called a Message, but needs to be broken down first into packets. IP (Internet Protocol) is a system set in place to take the packaged data and works with TCP and IP addresses to determine what to do with said data. TCP ensures that the packets travel consistently and reliably and are reassembled in the right sequence to reform the message.</p>

    <h1> How Does it Work (Step-by-Step)</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Your computer or device is connected to the internet through a router and modem. This allows you to connect to other networks around the world. Your router enables multiple computers to join the same network while a modem connects to your ISP (Internet Service Provider) which provides you with either cable or DSL internet.
      </li>
      <li>Enter the URL which signals your ISP where to go. Each URL is Unique</li>
      <li>Next, your browser looks up the IP address for the domain name you typed into your search engine through DNS. DNS then translates the text-based domain name you type into the browser into the number-based IP address</li>
      <li>Once the IP is found, your browser sends a HTTP request to target server to get copy of website to TCP/IP</li>
      <li>Server approves or disapproves the request and sends website files in packages to browser</li>
      <li>Your browser then reassembled the packages and creates the message i.e the website</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Key Terms</h1>
    <p><b>HTTP (Hypertext transfer Protocols):</b> The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application layer protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.</p>
    <p><b>Internet:</b> a global computer network providing a variety of information and communication facilities, consisting of interconnected networks using standardized communication protocols.</p>
    <p><b>NAP (Network Access Protection):</b> a Microsoft technology for controlling network access of a computer, based on its health. With NAP, system administrators of an organization can define policies for system health requirements.
    </p>
    <p><b>DNS(Domain Name System):</b> the phonebook of the Internet. When users type domain names such as ‘google.com’ or ‘nytimes.com’ into web browsers, DNS is responsible for finding the correct IP address for those sites.
    </p>
    <p><b>URL (Uniform Resource Locator):</b> a web address, is a reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. A URL is a specific type of Uniform Resource Identifier, although many people use the two terms interchangeably. </p>
    <p><b>Router:</b>  A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. Routers perform the traffic directing functions on the Internet. Data sent through the internet, such as a web page or email, is in the form of data packets.
    </p>
    <p><b>Modem:</b> modulates and demodulates electrical signals sent through phone lines, coaxial cables, or other types of wiring; in other words, it transforms digital information from your computer into analog signals that can transmit over wires, and it can translate incoming analog signals back into digital data that your computer can understand
    </p>
    <p><b>TCP (The Transmission Control Protocol):</b> is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite. It originated in the initial network implementation in which it complemented the Internet Protocol. Therefore, the entire suite is commonly referred to as TCP/IP.
    </p>
    <p><b>ISP:</b> An Internet service provider is an organization that provides services for accessing, using, or participating in the Internet. Internet service providers can be organised in various forms, such as commercial, community-owned, non-profit, or otherwise privately owned.</p>
    <p><b>CFR(Code of Federal Regulations):</b> The Code of Federal Regulations is the codification of the general and permanent rules and regulations published in the Federal Register by the executive departments and agencies of the federal government of the United States. The CFR is divided into 50 titles that represent broad areas subject to federal regulation.
    </p>
    <p><b>FCC (Federal Communications Commission):</b> regulates interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories. An independent U.S. government agency overseen by Congress, the commission is the United States' primary authority for communications law, regulation and technological innovation. In its work facing economic opportunities and challenges associated with rapidly evolving advances in global communications, the agency capitalizes on its competencies in:
      <li>Promoting competition, innovation and investment in broadband services and facilities</li>
      <li>Supporting the nation's economy by ensuring an appropriate competitive framework for the unfolding of the communications revolution
      </li>
      <li>Encouraging the highest and best use of spectrum domestically and internationally</li>
      <li>Revising media regulations so that new technologies flourish alongside diversity and localism
      </li>
      <li>Providing leadership in strengthening the defense of the nation's communications infrastructure
      </li></p>
      <p><b>IP Address:</b> An Internet Protocol address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. An IP address serves two main functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing.
        <li><b>Public IP Address: </b> Accessible over the internet</li>
        <li><b>Private IP Address</b>Assigned to a device on a closed network such as a home or business network that’s not accessible over the internet
        </li></p>
