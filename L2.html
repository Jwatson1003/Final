<h1>Privatized Ads</h1>

You’re not crazy, this is a marketing strategy set in place to incentivise you to buy certain products based on your searches. And this is all done through a thing called cookies.</p>
<h1>So...What are they?</h1>
<p>No Cookies aren’t the delicious little treats we’ve come to love, cookies are a small piece of data stored on the user's computer by the web browser while browsing a website. Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember stateful information or to record the user's browsing.</p>

<div class="pros">
<h1>Pros</h1>
<p><b>Online Shopping Experience:</b> Almost all eCommerce websites allow you to put items in a cart, leave the page, and return to resume shopping with your cart intact.
</p>
<p><b>Form Submissions:</b> Cookies can remember submitted information such as names and other fields on a form. It can save you valuable time when entering a live chat with your hosting support.</p>
<p><b>Personalization:</b> Cookies can also help store language preferences and currency preferences as well.</p>
<p><b>Suggested Content:</b> You can see this occur on shopping sites with a “Related Searches” feature. It relies on cookies to collect data, cross reference it with other users who have a similar profile, then make its recommendations.
</p>

<div class="cons">
<h1>Cons</h1>
<p><b>Privacy:</b> Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default. As a result, cookies are stored “invisibly” on your local machine every time you browse the internet. As a result, your browsing history and IP address become public knowledge.
</p>
<p><b>Local Storage</b> These “little” website cookies are actual files stored on your hard drive. The more you visit, the more that is stored. As it builds over time, it can take up quite a bit of storage space on your computer/mobile device.
</p>
<p><b>Unauthorized Data Collection: </b> Websites may sell the information collected from cookies to third parties or use it to hack into social networks or other online accounts.
